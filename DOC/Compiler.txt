Stage 1: Translation to Assembly

The tool will translate sourcecode into GAS-parseable assembly.

Phase 1: reproduce current sourcecode
Basis: 
- intel instructions
- multiplexing sections
- constant declarations

Pluggability: convert to any type of assembler syntax,
or to bytecode directly - serializer/writer.


Phase 2: macro's

Choice: either preserve, or unroll macro's when generating target
assembly source.


Phase 3: register management

- declare variable names for registers
- track usage/destruction
- determine preservation: warning/automatic push, pop
- algorithm to determine optimum register usage

This introduces 'knowledge' of the use of registers. Not all
registers are available for all instructions.
