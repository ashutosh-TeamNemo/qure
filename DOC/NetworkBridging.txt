QEMU: using OpenVPN Win32 TAP Driver on Windows 7.

Devices:
 - 'Wireless Network Connection':
 	HonHaiPr WiFi physical NIC: DHCP, LAN
 - 'Network Bridge':
 	MAC Bridge Miniport: virtual nic. (not sure where it came from)
 - 'tap-bridge':
 	OpenVPN TAP-Win32 Adapter V9 (2010).

Wireless is bridged to mac bridge;
tap-bridge is brided to mac bridge.


Requests from the VM: DHCP/PING:


tap-bridge TAP:

  - DHCP requests/responses appear with proper mac in both eth header
    and dhcp payload on tap-bridge. The problem is that the IP returned is
    the ip of the Network Bridge (or WiFi).

  - ICMP PING request/replies both show (with proper mac).

Mac Bridge Virtual NIC:

  - DHCP requests (sent from vm) appear on the mac bridge with the proper mac,
    but not the responses.

  - ICMP PING requests (sent from vm)/responses (from anywhere) do not show at all.
    (icmp destination unreachable's do show fro mother nics).


WiFi:

  - DHCP requests/responses appear on the WiFi, but with the MAC of the Wifi.
    Therefore the IP received from the router is the one for the WiFi's MAC,
    not the tap-bridge's mac.

  - ICMP PING request/replies both show, but with the WiFi's MAC.



So, for PING it seems the mac bridge gets bypassed alltogether (at least the
packets do not show up there).

For DHCP it seems that the mac bridge forwards the DHCP requests to the WiFi,
which then sends them using its own MAC.


In any case, the WiFi uses it's own MAC to put packets on the network
(doublecheck on other computer). This is not transparent.

It can also be that the tap-bridge driver does mac substitution.


Possible solution: have the DHCP server allow multiple IP's per mac. 
Downside: all vm's will share the same mac on the network.
