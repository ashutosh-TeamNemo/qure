Distributed Architecture


Setup with 2 instances on a LAN:

The internet gateway is configured to forward certain ports to a fixed ip.
Running two instances on a LAN then will have only one of them respond to
packets for the IP. The IP is (pre)configured in the os.

Initialisation routine on a LAN then involves pinging the fixed IP to
determine whether it is available. If so, the NIC is configured with the IP.
If not, another IP is chosen.

The machine that is not using the gateway's forward IP regularly pings the IP,
and when there is no response, reconfigures itself with the IP.

'Master/Slave'

In this setup, only one instance on the lan has the ip, and is called the
'master'. It may be aware of other instances using some protocol, and could
forward packets to load balance within a LAN.

[the above is a todo, there is no checks as yet to count the LAN instances]



WAN: .cloud

subdomain: cloud.neonics.com
subdomain DNS: cloudns.neonics.com (DYNA record).

The OS currently implements a DNS proxy for cloud.neonics.com,
returning the address for cloudns.neonics.com, which is the public ip
of the (so far) only instance running the OS.

The model can serve other domains aswell, and illustrates how updates
can propagate.

All cloud machines will check the main DNS server and register themselves
by using the DNS update mechanism.
