Bootsector:

16 bit real mode, uses BIOS to load more sectors (sector1).


Sector1:

16 bit real mode entry point.
Currently implements calls to BIOS.



Protected Mode:

I wonder whether calling 16 bit code (with a far return) is possible
in protected mode. The segment is marked 16 bit, and thus the instructions
are interpreted as such. As long as no segment changes are done...

Check v8086 mode, and real-mode gates to call bios, until the OS
can interact with the chipsets directly.
